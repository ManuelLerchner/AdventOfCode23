# Advent of Code 2023 

This repository contains my solutions and code for the Advent of Code 2023 challenges.

They are entirely written in `C++` as i am trying to learn the language.

## About Advent of Code

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual coding event that takes place in December. It consists of a series of daily coding challenges, each with two parts, released daily. The challenges cover a variety of algorithms and problem-solving skills.

## Solutions

- Each day's challenge has its own directory (e.g., `day01`, `day02`) containing the solution code.
- The `data` directory contains the input data for each day's challenge.

## Building

- Create a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`

- Run CMake: `cmake ..`

- Build the project: `make -j`

- Run the respective day's executable: `./bin/day01`
